## Contributing to Exchange Web Services Java API

There are several ways to contribute to the project:

* Report bugs and features in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/officedev/ews-java-api/issues).

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

### Contributing code and content
Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap.  You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code:

* [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza
* [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](http://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.

### Pull Requests
If you don't know what a pull request is read the "[Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)" article.

Some guidelines for pull requests:

* Use a descriptive title and description.
* Include a single logical change.
* Base on master branch - once accepted, can be ported to stable branches.
* Should cleanly merge with target branch.

### Commit Messages
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g. Fix #123: Make pigs fly).
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why.  The how should be mostly covered by the diff.
